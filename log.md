**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Link(s) to work**: [Calculator App](http://www.example.com) -->

**Today's Progress**: cloned down the reppo and publically declared that I will be starting 100 days of code.

**Thoughts:** I really want to be really good at Data Structures and Algos all reworking previous projects and working on new ones. My goal at the end of this is to just become a better developer, get a great job and belong to a wider network of passionate devs.
